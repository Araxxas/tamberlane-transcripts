TESS: You'd be surprised, my Bel.
BELFRY: Sure, but you're on the council. You'd vouch for me, right?

BELFRY: <em>YOU WOULDN'T VOUCH FOR ME?! </em>

BELFRY: <em>LEAD WITH THAT!!</em>

TESS: I was just thinking it wouldn't matter if I vouched for you. If you go Abroad, I can't help you. No matter how hard I try.
