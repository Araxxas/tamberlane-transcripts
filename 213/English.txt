SCOTT: What kind of book would you like to read?
TAMBERLANE: Um...well...

TAMBERLANE: I...I don't wanna say...
SCOTT: Is it a secret? I promise I won't tell anyone. 

TAMBERLANE: You won't get in trouble?
SCOTT: I promise.

TAMBERLANE: Everyone keeps saying I'm from Ab-...that...place.

TAMBERLANE: But I dunno know what it is! No one will say!

TAMBERLANE: What if Mummy's going to go away because of me? I'm scared... Are there books about that?

SCOTT: I think I have just the books for you.
