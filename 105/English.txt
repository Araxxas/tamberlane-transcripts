BELFRY: Briar?

BRIAR: I <i>mean</i> this is tearing our family apart!
BRIAR: You and Mum aren't talking!
BRIAR: Mum and Dad are <i>fighting</i> over it!

BRIAR: <em>AND I'M STUCK IN THE MIDDLE!</em>

BRIAR: If you fancy yourself a mum, then great! Fine!
BRIAR: You do you!

BRIAR: But would you stop being so <i>difficult?</i>
BRIAR: Come <i>home!</i>
