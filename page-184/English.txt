CALLIE: Over the next week, we'll be making a tree collage with things that remind us of our own roots!
CUR: An' wharrabout the <em>rest</em> of us blokes who don't know our roots, eh? We en't all cute little "ghosties" getting our paw helded!

CALLIE: CUR!! Must I put you on time out <em>again?!</em>
CUR: I en't bein' smart-alecky this time, honest!

CALLIE: Cur, Tamberlane <em>needs</em> paw-holding to integrate smoothly and catch up!

CUR: She seems plenty integrated to me! I bet she could ask all sortsa stupid questions an' you'd just <em>answer</em> em!

CALLIE: That's enough Cur! If you want help, you need only to <em>politely</em> ask for it! You needn't be rude to Tamberlane!
CUR: I weren't bein' rude! I was just askin' a question, wasn't I!
CALLIE: Next time, ask without disparaging another student!

CUR: Yes, <em>ma'am</em>.
