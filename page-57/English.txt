PENNY: Yes! It worked! We made it out!
TAMBERLANE: Blue!

PENNY: Oh, are you worried about my Papa?
TAMBERLANE: Owie!

PENNY: Don't worry about him. He's a sturdy bloke. He'll survive.

PENNY: Now, before we get caught, let's run!

PENNY: I said, let's run!
TAMBERLANE: Okie!

PENNY: Ugh! I'm starting to think you don't even know how to <em>walk</em>, much less <em>run!</em>
TAMBERLANE: Ugh!

PENNY: Guuhh... Fine, it's okay.
PENNY: We'll just teach you how to walk, too.

PENNY: Just hurry! I don't wanna get caught! 
PENNY: Gosh, I can't believe you're three.
