MILO: You wanted me to look at something?

OAKEWOOD: This is Tamberlane. Belfry Baker found her in the forest and adopted her.
OAKEWOOD: But we haven't the faintest clue what she is.

MILO: How fascinating! May I examine you?

TAMBERLANE: OkAGH!
MILO: Omnivorous dentition...

MILO: Front-facing visual range... Likely a predator...
MILO: She's perfect!

OAKEWOOD: Now hold up a tick!
OAKEWOOD: What do you mean, <i>"perfect"</i>?

MILO: For my <i>research project!<i>
