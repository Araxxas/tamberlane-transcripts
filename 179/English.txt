TIMMOTHY: Well, I think I've rambled on quite enough!

TIMMOTHY: Please enjoy this year's Sovereign Festival! Our ancestor's brave sacrifices allow us to get together from all over our fine country and celebrate! So sample some fine food, play some games, and celebrate the fruits of our labor!

TIMMOTHY: But I urge you to remember...

TIMMOTHY: When life demands a sacrifice...

TIMMOTHY: And you must choose between love and duty...

TIMMOTHY: Which will you choose?
