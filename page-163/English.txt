MILO, TAMBERLANE, OAKEWOOD: Abroad?

OAKEWOOD: That's absolute nonsense.

TAGG: Before you dismiss me, hear me out. There's something strange happening Abroad.

DANGER: Areas are blocked off or quarantined. No one will say why. 

TAGG: And creatures from Follybrook are vanishing.

OAKEWOOD: Come now! This has nothing to do with Tamberlane! Quarantines? Missing Creatures? That's utter poppy!

TAGG: You just don't want to believe me!
