OAKEWOOD: Well, alright then.  Go put her back.

BELFRY: What?! But I can't do that!

OAKEWOOD: Why not?  You just said you can't do it.
BELFRY: Yeah, but I can't just leave her to die!

OAKEWOOD: Fair enough.  Give her to someone else, then.

BELFRY: But I... they wouldn't...

BELFRY: No one else cared, and... I can't.

OAKEWOOD: My goodness! I guess you'll just have to do it yourself!
