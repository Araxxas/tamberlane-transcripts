PEEK: Got your order in from Tangled Branch this morning.
OAKEWOOD: Excellent.

PEEK: Actually, I have something else you might be interested in.

OAKEWOOD: Oh?
PEEK: Yeah, I got it in about a month ago.

PEEK: I did my best restoring and rebinding it, but it was tricky.

OAKEWOOD: Alright, you've piqued my interest. What is it?

PEEK: This book is very, very old. Honestly, you'd need a better expert than me to get much out of it, but...

PEEK: Since you were broadening your research, I thought it might help.
