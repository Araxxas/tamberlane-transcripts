OAKEWOOD: Good morning, Gentlemen.

SCOTT: It seems we have a party!
PEEK: Ah, come to fetch your books, Claude?
OAKEWOOD: Indeed, I have. And I believe Miss Tamberlane has some errands here, too. 

TAMBERLANE: Hi Mister Scott!
SCOTT: Why hello there Miss Tamberlane! What can I do for you?

TAMBERLANE: Mummy said...Mummy said I could have books.

BELFRY: We're looking for some books to help cheer her up after a rough day.

SCOTT: A bad day? We can't have that, now can we? How about we pick some out?
TAMBERLANE: Yes, please!
