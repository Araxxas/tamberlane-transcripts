OAKEWOOD: So I take it you and youur crew haven't run into anything like her, then?

GILLIAN: I'm afraid not, chap.
GILLIAN: It... she?
GILLIAN: ...is quite unfamiliar to me. Terribly sorry.
GILLIAN: [whispered] yuck.

SMALL BAT 2: Captain, I have an idea of who might know.
GILLIAN: Siiiigh...
GILLIAN: True...

GILLIAN: Say, since you were so kind to mention it, Artie, why don't <i>you</i> go fetch Milo?

ARTIE: Do I have to? He sicked up all over his cabin earlier.

GILLIAN: Someone must, and it won't be me.
GILLIAN: Consider it Captain's orders.

ARTIE: grumble, grumble
ARTIE: ...aye, Captain...
