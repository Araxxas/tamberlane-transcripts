SFX: Deep Sigh

BELFRY: Look, Mum. I know you hate Tamberlane, but you have to come to terms with the fact that she is here to stay.

TESS: <em>What?!</em> I don't <em>hate</em> Tamberlane!

BELFRY: Oh, really.
TESS: <em>Yes</em>, really! I actually think she's very sweet!

TESS: To be honest, she may have grown on me. <em> A LITTLE.</em> 

TESS: <em>But that's a problem!</em>
