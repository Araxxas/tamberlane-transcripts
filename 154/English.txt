TESS: No.

WALTER: We are not ready for this very loud kit!
TESS: No.

WALTER: Tess, my darling...
TESS: No.

WALTER: So you see, your mother was very enthusiastic about keeping the little Belfry. We had many talks. But I did come around. Obviously.

WALTER: So I say, Tess understands. She has other reasons to dispute. But they will work it out. They have the same personality
BRIAR: Okay, Okay I get it.
