TESS: The care this thing needs... We don't have the facilities here in Treehollow.

TESS: You'd have to go... abroad.

BELFRY: I don't CARE. Nothing you say will make me put it back!
TAMBERLANE: Don't care!

TESS: Belfry, you don't understand!
BELFRY: Oh, I understand perfectly! Stop treating me like a child! I'm nineteen!
TAMBERLANE: Wah!

ANTHONY: This is a bad idea.
BRIAR: I love Belfry, but...yeah.
PIPER: Brilliant! I can't wait to see all the BLOOD!
