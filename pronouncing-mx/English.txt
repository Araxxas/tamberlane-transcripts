QUESTION: Dear Mx Ainsley, It's so empowering that you don't subscribe to society's gender norms. That said, I always wondered how properly pronounce your honorific. Is it pronounced "Mizz"? "Mix"? Knowing how to say it might come in handy to avoid an embarrassing social gaffe.

QUESTION: Also, I like your shirt. Where can someone find something similar in style to it?

AINSLEY: Uhhhh! Th..thank you for the respectful queestion, mysterious voice from the sky.

AINSLEY: You could have asked any of the non-bianary creatures in town, but you asked me. Um... Thanks for that too?? I guess?

AINSLEY: I'm so glad it's empowering for you! But thankfully, gender norms are pretty loose here. They don't dictate a whole lot outside preference and reproduction.

AINSLEY: The truth is, I don't feel like any gender at all, and it really doesn't impact my role in society. here. Who cares?

AINSLEY: Was that everything...?

AINSLEY: Oh jeeze! I didn't even answer the question!

AINSLEY: It's prounounced "Mix" and Avery makes all my clothes.
