BELFRY: I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HER IN THE WOODS!
TESS: No, I KNOW that! I...

TESS: This isn't coming out right.
BRIAR: Belfry, let Mum talk.

TESS: Bel, my darling waif, you have to understand that I'm....scared. I'm scared you'll become a pariah.

BELFRY: MUM! Everyone LOVES Tamberlane!

TESS: I know, I know! But when she gets sick, How do we treat her? How do we know our medicine isn't a poison for her? She isn't a normal kit, Belfry. And that's fine except...It's a better than average chance she is going to need advanced medicine. 

TESS: If that happens, you're going to have to choose whether to let her die, or take her Abroad. 
BELFRY: Ugh, Mum..!
