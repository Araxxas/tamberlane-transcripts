CALLIE: Alright, alright! Settle down! We're nearly done for the day. Starting tomorrow, we're going to be learning about our roots!

TAMBERLANE: Roots? Like a tree? I have <em>roots</em>?
CALLIE: We all do, in a way!

CALLIE: Your roots are where you come from.

CALLIE: They're made up of our hometowns, our families, and even our ancestors!

CALLIE: Our roots make us who we are.

SFX: OOF!
MARIE: Aw, Tamberlane! Stop fretting! Your roots are right here in Treehollow!

Piper: Yeah! You've been our infamous Rattleglen ghostie for a whole year now! If those aren't roots, I dunno what is!
