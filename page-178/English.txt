TIMMOTHY: Torn between love and duty, she found herself on the precipice of fate.

TIMMOTHY: Resisting the pull of safety, of warmth, she surged into the enemy compound.

TIMMOTHY: With building courage, she prepared to strike.

TIMMOTHY: And strike she did! She struck the first blow that would cascade in time to this, our free and sovereign present!

TIMMOTHY: Though she was killed a few years later, we would always remember her...

TIMMOTHY ...As Nairobi, the match that started a thousand fires.
