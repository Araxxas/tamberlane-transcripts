PEEK: I heard the cubs are going to Bally Bluffs next week?
BELFRY: Yes! I'm chaperoning!

PEEK: Ah! In that case...There's good deal of limonite in that area and I'm running low on my umber pigment. If you could just pop out and pick up a few orangey rocks from up near the bluffs themselves, I'd owe you one.

BELFRY: Hmm...just any orangey rock?

PEEK: Any one will do. It may not be precisely what I need, but it'll be close enough to see me through until I can go myself. 

BELFRY: Deal! Even I can do that!

PEEK: Aces! Then you're all set to go, Miss Belfry!
SCOTT: Let me know if you have any more questions, okay, Tamberlane?
TAMBERLANE: Okay! Thank you, Mister Scott!
