COYOTE: What's the matter this time?
AINSLEY: They want me to take them to the ghost, but I don't want to! I can't go back!

COYOTE: Lucky for you, there's no such thing as ghosts.
COYOTE: You conspiracy theorist whackjob.

AINSLEY: Oh, very nice, Oakewood!
AINSLEY: You can only say that because you didn't see what I saw!

OAKEWOOD: You're right! I didn't!
OAKEWOOD: Golly, if I had...

OAKEWOOD: I STILL WOULDN'T CALL IT A GHOST BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST!
AINSLEY: Or maybe you're a closed-minded jerkface.
