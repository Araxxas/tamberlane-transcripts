KID 1: What happens when someone goes Abroad?
KID 2: What’s it like there?
KID 3: Why’s it called Abroad, anyway? Is that what it’s really called?
KID 4: Why can’t you just go and visit?
KID 5: How far away is it?

KID 6: I just don’t understand why we can’t even ask!
KID 1: Have you ever been there, Miss Callie?
KID 2: Where is Abroad?
TAMBERLANE: Am I from there?
KID 3: Can you ever get untainted?
KID 4: When you get tainted, do you grow, like, a third eye?!

CALLIE: ENOUGH!!!

CALLIE: We are not speaking of Abroad! This behavior is beyond inappropriate!

JENTZEN: Callie.

JENTZEN: Why aren’t you telling them? It is important that they know.

CALLIE: Absolutely not, Jentzen! The edicts clearly state that under no circumstances are we to speak of it to students…
JENTZEN: The edicts are wrong!!

PIPER: What’s the edicts?
MARIE: I dunno.
