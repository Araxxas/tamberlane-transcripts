Kid 1: What happens when someone goes Abroad?
Kid 2: What’s it like there?
Kid 3: Why’s it called Abroad, anyway? Is that what it’s really called?
Kid 4: Why can’t you just go and visit?
Kid 5: How far away is it?

Kid 6: I just don’t understand why we can’t even ask!
Kid 1: Have you ever been there, Miss Callie?
Kid 2: Where is Abroad?
Tamberlane: Am I from there?
Kid 3: Can you ever get untainted?
Kid 4: When you get tainted, do you grow, like, a third eye?!

Callie: ENOUGH!!!

Callie: We are not speaking of Abroad! This behavior is beyond inappropriate!

Jentzen: Callie.

Jentzen: Why aren’t you telling them? It is important that they know.

Callie: Absolutely not, Jentzen! The edicts clearly state that under no circumstances are we to speak of it to students…
Jentzen: The edicts are wrong!!

Piper: What’s the edicts?
Marie: I dunno.
