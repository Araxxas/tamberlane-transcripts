FOX:This technology seems so <strong>strange</strong> and <strong>futuristic.</strong> Is this supposed to be paper?
BOAR: I'm <strong>really</strong> out of my element with this. I hope I'm doing this right.
TERRA: Umm, Nora?
BABY- HEH-HAHA!

FOX:Such a <strong>unusua</strong>l brush... Is there there and <strong>alternative method</strong> to select a color other than white with the tip of the cord?
BOAR: No <strong>CRTL?</strong> No <strong>Shift?</strong> Why are your <strong>traditional methods</strong> so difficult?!
TERRA: <strong>NORA?!</strong>

FOX: Is it proper to chip away at the board like this?

TERRA: NORA?!?!?!

BOAR: This thing <strong>at least</strong> comes with an undo button, <strong>right???</strong>
