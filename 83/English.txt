NORA: I know you think this is a Belfry problem, but this is normal. If you haven't noticed, Penny is missing too.

NORA: PENNY! Quit it! Mummy is doing important things!

NORA: The look on her face... It's enough to make me wonder if I'm a bad parent.

NORA: There's no rulebook for any of us, Bel.
