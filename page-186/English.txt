CALLIE: S-so, when we go to Bally Bluffs, I'll have brought plenty of parchment for our roots projects...

KIRA: Hey, Marie, you were right! Nice subject change, Teach!
SFX: HAHAHA

MARIE: Oh, <em>please</em>, Miss Callie, just tell us!

ANTHONY: Grown-ups make it sound so <em>terrifying</em>... 
PIPER: And <em>awesome</em>!

CALLIE: It is not awesome! We don't talk about...<em>that place</em>...
KIRA: Maybe we didn't before, but since Tamberlane got here, it's all you grown-ups ever whisper about!
CALLIE: Children, <em>please</em>, this is <em>highly</em> innapropriate!

ANTHONY: Why do some creatures <em>choose</em> to go there?

MARIE: How come being sick is just as bad as being a traitor?

PIPER: And why do you get tainted so you can't come back?
