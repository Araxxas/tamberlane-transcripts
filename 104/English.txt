BRIAR: Come on, don't bite the messenger. You know how mum gets.

BRIAR: Look. She just wanted me to ask you to help out at the booth tomorrow at the festival.

BELFRY:  You tell mum that if she wants me at the booth, she can com here and ask me <em>herself!</em>

BELFRY: Isn't that just <i>so like her?</i>
BELFRY: Sending my little sister to do her <i>dirty work!</i>

BELFRY: Couldn't come and ask me, <i>oh no!</i>

BRIAR: Bel, <i>stop!</i>
BRIAR: Come on!

BRIAR: Don't you think this is a <i>little</i> silly?
