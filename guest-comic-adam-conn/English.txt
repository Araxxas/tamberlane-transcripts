WHITE: Obsessing our own faults blinds us to the beauty we bring into this world. Stray threads of kindness holding each other up. Our passions, assistance, love, weaving a fabric between us, providing an unspoken support and connecting us all in a large community, built on the small kindnesses we send into the world unwittingly. A compliment, a hand, a smile, providing strength to navigate our crazy lives. So take a hand if you need it. We all need it sometimes. And know that there are always those out there with you even when the world seems darkest.
