PENNY: So what's your favorite book?
TAMBERLANE: muh?

PENNY: You know, books? Reading?

PENNY: Do you even know how to read?

PENNY: How old are you?
TAMBERLANE: Tree.
PENNY: Wow! Me too! And you don't know how to read yet?

PENNY: Well...that's okay!

PENNY: Mum says all creatures grow at their own pace.

PENNY: Y'know, Parsley's quite good at teaching little kids how to read.

PENNY: Let's go find him!

PENNY: But we've got to be careful.
