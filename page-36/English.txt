TESS: Bel, what...?
HENRY: What is it?

OAKEWOOD: My new research project.
BELFRY: MY TAMBERLANE!

TESS: Oh, stars. Oh, stars, oh stars! Bel, you can't keep that thing!
BELFRY: I can, and I will.

TESS: Belfry, it's-- it's deformed.
BELFRY: It's my kit now.

TESS: It has no fur! It's going to freeze in the winter! Can it even breathe with a muzzle that flat?
BELFRY: DON'T CARE! MY KIT!
