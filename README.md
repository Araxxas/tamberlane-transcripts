# How to Submit Transcripts for Tamberlane

Each comic page has its own folder.

In the folder for that comic, create a new .txt file. Give it the name of the language as it should appear on the webpage. For example, the Spanish language file should be "Espa√±ol.txt".

Paste in the transcript.

HTML formatting is allowed. Make sure to escape any ampersands (&) with &amp;, less than (<) with &lt;, and greater than (>) with &gt;.
