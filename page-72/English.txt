MARIE: I'm so sorry! Oh, please stop hitting yourself!

MARIE: There, there, darling. I'm sure Parsley can help you.
MARIE: What'd you bring him?

TAMBERLANE: h-huh?

MARIE: Right...You're not from around here, are you?

TAMBERLANE: uwwWAAAHH
MARIE: Oh no, no, don't fret! I'll explain it!

MARIE: Parsley is an older kid who knows a lot of stuff.

MARIE: He'll help creatures out but he usually charges an item of personal significance.

MARIE: But don't worry! He has a heart.
MARIE: I'm sure he'll be charitable to a newcomer.
MARIE: So no more crying, okay?
TAMBERLANE: okee
